Here's how you should lay out your directory tree:

build\
      chromium\
               depot_tools\
               chromium\
                        .gclient
                        6.0.543.2\
                        src\
      berkelium\
                win32\

I would recommend having a copy of cygwin so that you can use it if necessary.
If you use Cygwin, it may reset your permissions whenever you do anything, so watch out

Download depot_tools:
http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools

The instructions for building Chromium on windows can be found here:
http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code#TOC-Windows

Look in VERSION.txt in berkelium to see which version to check out.

Check out Chromium using gclient.
If it's a release version (e.g. 6.0.543.2), then use this command:
  gclient config http://src.chromium.org/svn/releases/CHROMIUM_VERSION
If it's a subversion version (e.g. 65432), then use:
  gclient config http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src 

Next, disable LayoutTests. They take 2 hours just to download for me. :-p
Open up .gclient in an editor and add: (see Reducing the size of your checkout)
    "custom_deps" : {
      "src/third_party/WebKit/LayoutTests": None,
      "third_party/WebKit/LayoutTests": None,
    }

If it's a release version (e.g. 6.0.543.2), then use this command:
  gclient sync
If it's a subversion version (e.g. 65432), then use:
  gclient sync -r 'src@CHROMIUM_VERSION'

Next, you need to patch Chromium. Otherwise, it can't be linked to berkelium.
It is best to apply all the patches from berkelium/patches -- those that do not apply to windows won't cause any harm, so apply them anyway.
If you use Cygwin, locate yourself in the chromium/chromium/src directory and you can do:
  for p in ../../../berkelium/patches/*.patch; do patch -p0 < $p || echo FAIL $p; done
You can also use a Win32 native version of patch.exe.

Make sure you have the right version of Visual Studio installed.
As of this writing (Jan 2011), only VS 2008 and 2005 are supported--not 2010. I advise using VS 2008 if at all possible. VS 2005 is old, slow, has more bugs, and requires more patches.

Now, follow the directions here to build Chromium:
http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/build-instructions-windows
Make sure to choose whether you want a Debug or Release build. I recommend Release unless you're trying to modify chromium internals.

You only need to build the "chrome" target, not the whole solution.

Last step, assuming that Chromium built successfully is to build Berkelium's project files.
If all went well, berkelium should find the chrome files and link to them.

Finally, after Berkelium built, you will need to copy some files from your chrome checkout:
chromium\src\chrome\Release\ or chromium\src\chrome\Debug\

Currently, the files you need to copy are:
        avcodec-52.dll
        avformat-52.dll
        avutil-50.dll
        icudt46.dll
        libEGL.dll
        libGLESv2.dll
        locales\
                en-US.dll
        resources.pak
        wow_helper.exe

Put one copy into your binary package, since you need to ship these with your executable.

I recommend making an extra copy directly into berkelium/win32 so you can debug the berkelium library and related programs directly from Visual Studio
