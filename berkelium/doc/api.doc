/** \page api API Reference
 *
 * Berkelium's API is relatively small -- it provides a minimal
 * interface to a web browser, allowing for JavaScript, mouse, and
 * keyboard inputs and outputs to a memory buffer. The following are the
 * important
 *
 *  - \ref Berkelium "Berkelium" - A few static methods are used to initialize
 *    and run the core event loop.
 *  - \ref Berkelium::Window "Window" - A single browser window, the core object
 *    used by embedders.
 *  - \ref Berkelium::WindowDelegate "WindowDelegate" - Listens for events
 *    generated by Windows such as load events, paint events, and widget
 *    events.
 *  - \ref Berkelium::Context "Context" - An opaque rendering context which
 *    multiple Windows can share.
 *  - \ref Berkelium::Widget "Widget" - A UI widget which accepts mouse and
 *    keyboard input.
