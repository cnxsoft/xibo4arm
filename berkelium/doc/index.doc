 * Berkelium is a
 * <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php"> BSD
 * licensed </a> library that provides off-screen browser rendering
 * via Google's open source <a href="http://www.chromium.org/">
 * Chromium </a> web browser. It takes advantage of Chromium's
 * multiprocess rendering to isolate browsers from each other and can
 * render to any buffer in memory.  The user of the library can inject
 * input and javascript code into web pages to control them, as well
 * as listen for events generated by the page such as navigation
 * events, load sequence events and paint events. Berkelium provides a
 * small API for embedding a fully functional browser into any
 * application.
