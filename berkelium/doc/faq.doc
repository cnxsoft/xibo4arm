 *
 * <h3> Q: What can Berkelium be used for? </h3>
 * \em A: Berkelium can be used anywhere you want to embed a web browser and
 * need to control exactly how display or input are handled.  As opposed to
 * standard browser solutions, the browser is rendered off screen, into any
 * buffer you like, and input is provided by you. In all other respects it is
 * like a normal browser.
 *
 * Berkelium can be used in a number of applications.  Examples include
 * embedding documentation into a game, using local web pages as UI elements, or
 * even mapping browsers onto 3D objects to embed 2D pages directly into your
 * 3D application. See \ref users for a full list of current uses.
 *
 * <h3> Q: Which operating systems does Berkelium run under? </h3>
 * \em A: Windows, Mac & Linux.
 *
 * <h3> Q: Are plugins supported? </h3>
 * \em A: Berkelium should support plugins, but currently that support is
 * limited to Flash (supported on all platforms). Development effort is not
 * focused on supporting additional plugins because standards based approaches
 * are preferred and Flash support covers a large fraction applications that
 * require plugins.
 *
 * For the curious with some spare time, it may be possible to use
 * a hooked HDC on Windows, and to use the X11 Composite extension to render
 * plugins to OpenGL on Linux. However, we suspect enabling arbitrary plugins
 * and programs in this way would take a good month of work to get right.
